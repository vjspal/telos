The user wanted to replace the sample content with their own biography and to host an additional TELOS file at a new location. \n", "- **Role:** I acted as a TELOS coach and project assistant, responsible for gathering accurate personal data, updating the TELOS file, and managing the GitHub deployment pipeline.\n", "\n", "## Work Undertaken\n", "1. **Gathering personal information:**  \n", "   * Searched across internal connectors (Google Drive, Gmail, Notion) to collect basic biographical data. From the user’s Drive we retrieved a resume revealing their hometown (Montgomery, AL), work history in the hospitality industry, education, and contact information. The Gmail search provided location snippets confirming Montgomery, while Notion pages yielded no additional personal data.\n", "\n", "2. **Drafting a new TELOS document:**  \n", "   * Used the TELOS framework to convert the resume details into structured sections (history, problems, missions, narratives, goals, challenges, strategies, projects, and log entries).  \n", "   * Replaced the existing placeholder content in `personal_telos.md` with the user’s personalized TELOS narrative, ensuring each section reflected their career goals and experiences in the hospitality field.\n", "\n", "3. **Updating the GitHub repository:**  \n", "   * Committed the new `personal_telos.md` to the `vjspal/telos` repository.  \n", "   * Fixed the GitHub Actions workflow by editing `.github/workflows/publish-telos.yml` to grant the proper permissions and correct syntax. This allowed the workflow to run successfully and deploy the updated TELOS JSON to GitHub Pages.\n", "\n", "4. **Creating an additional TELOS location:**  \n", "   * Copied the updated TELOS JSON from the deployed site and created a new file `public/.well-known/telos-new.json` in the repository.  \n", "   * Committed the new file directly to `main`, triggering the GitHub Actions workflow. The workflow generated and published the new JSON file, making it accessible via the URL `https://vjspal.github.io/telos/.well-known/telos-new.json`.\n", "\n", "5. **Verification:**  \n", "   * Checked the Actions tab to confirm all workflow runs succeeded.  \n", "   * Verified that both the original and new TELOS JSON endpoints correctly reflected the user’s personalized data.\n", "\n", "## Problem Solved\n", "The project replaced outdated placeholder content with a personalised TELOS document and set up an additional endpoint for it. This involved gathering reliable personal data, updating repository files, and troubleshooting deployment issues until the new content was published via GitHub Pages.\n", "\n", "## What’s Next\n", "- **Further refinement:** The user can continue refining their TELOS document, adding log entries and projects as they progress.  \n", "- **Additional endpoints:** If more TELOS versions are needed (e.g., professional vs. personal), the established process can be repeated to create and publish additional JSON files.  \n", "- **Maintenance:** Monitor GitHub Actions runs for future updates to ensure continued deployment success.\n"]}], "metadata": {}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 5}
